Target Audience: Novice biologists and those of greater skill/experience

How much initial user knowledge can be assumed? How much can results be simplified/explained?

How far will the final tool reach (commercially)

How much customization will be available?
General guidelines

Stakeholders: 
	Biologists/Researchers
	Curators of public databases
	
Decide upon scope:
	Scanning entire eukaryotic database = tons of data
	Scan it all? Filter for relevance?
	Download or cloud? / High-throughput vs parallel
	Info vs Speed
	
What will user input? Begin with query to db?
	
Why is this tool necessary?
What do biologists hope to learn/demonstrate using this tool that could not be done (at least as easily) with an existing tool?

Further ways to interact with data? (3D graphs?)

Current resources:
Current BI pipelines
Genetics Cluster
CBCB
Ben Rodgers (high-performance computing)
Computing resources! CoE, BME, buy our own?


How much info to show, to save, etc.? 

Define "semi-automated"
